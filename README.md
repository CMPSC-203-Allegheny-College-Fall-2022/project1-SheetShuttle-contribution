## Summary

In this short-term project, you will contribute to the SheetShuttle tool by resolving one of the issues in its issue tracker. To receive full points for this assignment, you should create a pull request and see that it is merged into the main branch of SheetShuttle. As part of this assignment, you should also answer all of the questions in the `report.md` file, furnishing evidence of your contributions to this week's effort towards completing the short-term software engineering project. Before the due date for this project assignment, please ensure that:

- You are able to build, test, and use the current version of SheetShuttle.

- You understand the purpose and functionality of SheetShuttle.

- You have a clear understanding of how to use GitHub project board.

- You explored the Python programs and packages used by the SheetShuttle.

- This GitHub repository contains a completed team report file.

- You participated in the planning and all four scrum meetings of the sprint.

- You participated in the sprint review and sprint retrospective.

- You completed all sprint assigned tasks, for example, you made significant contributions to your team's branch for this sprint, as evidenced by commits to the branch.

- You made significant contributions towards your team's merge of your team branch to the main branch of the SheetShuttle using the GitHub Flow model. If this task was not accomplished by your team, provide a clear documentation of the problems that you have encountered.

- You contributed to your scrum lead's management of the GitHub project board.

_Please note that if you took a role of a **scrum lead**, although you are expected to contribute to development, you are not expected to contribute to implementation as much as your development team since your main tasks include organizing meetings, making sure everyone is on track (help resolve issues as needed), checking in with your product owner to keep them informed, and organizing project board with input from your team, the chief scrum lead, and product owners (TLs). Additionally, if you are a_ chief scrum lead_, you will need to communicate with all scrum leads to ensure proper collaboration and avoidance of conflicts among the work done by all teams._

## Objectives

- To practice organizing teams and team roles in preparation for the main software engineer project.

- To experience project onboarding by getting to know a new tool, SheetShuttle.

- To learn how to use Github project boards to manage a software project.

- To practice scrum agile methodology in the short-term software engineer project.

- To experience planning, estimation, and implementation during a sprint.

- To continue to learn how to use a GitHub board to manage a software project.

- To continue to learn how to use GitHub and the GitHub Flow model, including [Git branch naming conventions](https://deepsource.io/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/) to support collaboration among a team of software engineers.

- To continue to learn how to use Markdown to complete technical writing tasks.

- To reflect on the process of software engineering to be able to continue improving professional and technical skills.

## Code of Conduct

Throughout the completion of this software engineering project you must adhere to the code of conduct that we developed as part of a previous laboratory assignment. In addition to reporting any violations of the code of conduct, please make sure that you attest to the fact that you followed the code of conduct. That is, make sure you have signed the Code of Conduct document in its repository. Students who think that the software engineering team should revise some aspect of the code of conduct must use the GitHub issue tracker for that repository to suggest, discuss, and implement any required changes.

## Process

To facilitate collaboration, the class will be split into teams of four/five students each. Your team will be responsible for at least one issue in the SheetShuttle's issue tracker.

The class will work on SheetShuttle using agile software development and scrum. Over two weeks, you will participate in one two-week-long sprint. During this one sprint cycle, your team will conduct sprint planning, stand-up, sprint review, and sprint retrospective meetings, guided by your scrum lead, who is the team member selected at the beginning of the project to act as a lead. While your team may choose to conduct some meetings only within your team, your team may find it helpful to involve other teams or the instructor in certain meetings, such as sprint planning and sprint review. It is up to the class to coordinate all meetings that are necessary to ensure that the majority of the current issues in the SheetShuttle's issue tracker are resolved by the end of this short-term project. Please note that teams are expected to have to meet and work both inside and outside of class.

As you work on SheetShuttle, you must use GitHub flow, adhere to the course code of conduct, and follow best practices in software engineering, software design, and software testing as discussed throughout the course. While you are encouraged to have discussions in person or through Discord, you must document important details that arise from these discussions, especially those about requirements, in the issue tracker for SheetShuttle.

### Sprint Planning

During sprint planning meetings, your team should engage in the following activities:

- Assess the quality of the requirements in the SheetShuttle issue tracker and communicate with the customer (Noor Buchi and/or JJ) if the requirements are not complete, precise, non-conflicting, or verifiable.
- Select the requirements that will be completed during the sprint and assign tasks to specific team members in the GatorGrade issue tracker, making sure to divide labor equitably in a way that will enable all team members to complete all required individual contributions.
- Estimate the effort that will be required to complete each task to resolve the issue you decided to tackle.
- Communicate with other teams about the issue(s) you are tackling to coordinate efforts.
- Show the sprint backlog by moving selected requirement(s) into the **In progress** column of the SheetShuttle project.

### Stand-up

During stand-up meetings, each team member should take one or two minutes to answer the following questions:

1. What did I complete since the last stand-up?
2. What will I work on until the next stand-up?
3. Am I blocked by anything?

## Team Presentation

At the end of this short-term project, your team will prepare an 8-to-10-minute presentation to showcase your team's work on SheetShuttle. This presentation will be followed by a 5-minute question and answer (Q & A) session. Your presentation should include:

- Overview of Work: a high-level description of your team's work on the issue.
- Technical Details: technical details such as any notable dependencies or tools used and why your team chose them over other comparable tools, implementation challenge that your team faced and how you overcame it, or testing challenge that your team faced and how you overcame it.
- Demonstration: as relevant to the issue that each team takes up.

### Sprint Review

During sprint review meetings, your team should engage in the following activities:

- Demonstrate the work you completed during the sprint to the customer.
- Demonstrate the work you complete during the sprint to other teams, as needed.
- Move completed requirements from the **In progress** column to the **Done** column of the SheetShuttle project.

### Sprint Retrospective

During sprint retrospective meetings, your team should engage in the following activities:

- Discuss what went well during the sprint.
- Discuss what your team wants to do differently during the next sprint.

## Getting Started with SheetShuttle

You should first familiarize yourself with SheetShuttle by reading the documents Noor Buchi prepared about the project:

1. [Getting started document]
2. [SheetShuttle README]
3. [Schemas]
4. [API setup guide]
5. [Tutorial]

Please note that SheetShuttle uses several Python dependencies and other tools, which you will get to know more during our class and lab sessions:

- **Poetry:** used to manage the Python virtualenv and dependencies, as well as build the project and run tasks.
- **Pytest:** used for unit tests. Important concepts in Pytest that are used are parametrized testing, Pytest fixtures, and code coverage.
- **Typer:** used to implement the command line interface of SheetShuttle.
- **PyGitHub:** used to interact with GitHub's API.
- **google-api-python-client:** used to interact with Google Sheets API.
- **pluginbase:** used to integrate user defined plugins into SheetShuttle.
- **jsonschema:** used to validate user input based on the schemas we define for the Google Sheets and Github configuration.
- **GitHub Actions:** used to run continuous integration tests as well as other workflows to test SheetShuttle.
- **CodeCov:** used to track unit test code coverage.

After reading the documentation, you should try to run SheetShuttle by

- installing the dependencies using `poetry install`, and
- running `poetry run sheetshuttle run`, which will run the default `hello world` plugin (it should print out `hello` from the default plugin to your console).

## Receiving Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this assignment, then please talk with either the course instructor or a student technical leader during the lab session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Discord channel for this course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours.

## Assessment

This assignment will be assessed based on the following components:

- **Percentage of Passing GitHub Actions Checks in project1 repo [up to 5%]**: GitHub Actions runs GatorGrader baseline writing and commit checks as well as linting checks. You should repeatedly revise your technical writing until it also passes all of GatorGrader's checks about, for instance, the length of its content.

  - Please note that the "Check Spelling" GitHub Actions check may flag proper nouns or other real words if the dictionary it uses does not contain them. If your "Check Spelling" GitHub Actions check is failing due to a correctly spelled word being incorrectly flagged as "unknown" by CSpell, you will need to add the word to the list of words in `.github/cspell.json`.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up to 15%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when the responses to the writing questions presented in the `report.md` reveal a proficiency of both writing skills and technical knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing should be complete and have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate answers.

- **Level of Contribution [up to 30%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when their level of contribution indicates active engagement in the process of planning, implementation and testing for this short-term software engineering project. The engagement should be reported in the report document located in this repository and be evident in the commit log and issue tracker communication.

- **Mastery of Software Engineering Concepts and Skills [up to 30%]**: Students will receive a grade for their technical contributions. As a part of this grade, the instructor will assess aspects of the sprint including, but not limited to, the completion of assigned tasks, the use of effective GitHub issues, use of project board, correct use of GitHub flow practices, and contributions made to the SheetShuttle.

### GatorGrade

You can check the baseline requirements of this project by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool in this repository. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python installed. Then, if you haven't done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

- [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`
