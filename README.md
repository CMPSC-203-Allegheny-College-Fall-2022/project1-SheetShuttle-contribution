# Project 1: Contributing to SheetShuttle

## Due: Thursday, October 13th, 2022 at 11 am

## Summary

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter for Laboratory 2 in Computer Science 203\. As part of this assignment, you should answer all of the questions in the `reflection.md` file, furnishing evidence of your contributions to this week's effort towards completing the long-term software engineering project. Students who have questions about this task should talk with a student technical leader or the course instructor. Before the due date for this laboratory assignment, please ensure that:

- You are able to build, test, and use the current version of SheetShuttle.

- You understand the purpose and functionality of SheetShuttle.

- You have a clear understanding of how to use GitHub project board.

- You made significant contributions in your team, as evidenced by creation of new issues and appropriate modifications made to existing issues in the project repository.

- You explored the Python programs and packages used by the long-term software engineering project.

- This GitHub repository contains a completed report file.

- You participated in the sprint review and sprint retrospective of sprint 0.

- You participated in the planning and all three scrum meetings of sprint 1.

- You completed all sprint 1 assigned tasks, for example, you made significant contributions to your team's branch for sprint 1, as evidenced by commits to the branch.

- You made significant contributions towards your team's merge of your team branch to the master branch of the GatorMiner using the GitHub Flow model. If this task was not accomplished by your team, provide a clear documentation of the problems that you have encountered.

- You contributed to your scrum lead's management of the ZenHub board.

- Sprint 1 does not have any unresolved issues in it that you could have already handled.

- This GitHub repository contains a completed reflection file.

_Please note that if you took a role of a **scrum lead**, although you are expected to contribute to development, you are not expected to contribute to implementation as much as your development team since your main tasks include organizing meetings, making sure everyone is on track (help resolve issues as needed), checking in with your product owner to keep them informed, and organizing ZenHub board with input from your team, the chief scrum lead, and product owners (TLs). Additionally, if you are a_ chief scrum lead_, you will need to communicate with all scrum leads to ensure proper collaboration and avoidance of conflicts among the work done by all teams._

## Code of Conduct

Throughout the completion of this software engineering project you must adhere to the code of conduct that we developed as part of a previous laboratory assignment. In addition to reporting any violations of the code of conduct, please make sure that you attest to the fact that you followed the code of conduct. That is, make sure you have signed the Code of Conduct document in its repository. Students who think that the software engineering team should revise some aspect of the code of conduct must use the GitHub issue tracker for that repository to suggest, discuss, and implement any required changes.

## Technical and Professional Skills

Even though this long-term software engineering project involves a multiple-week effort, you are expected to make significant contributions to the project every week. As a means for documenting your contributions to this project, you should fully complete the reflection document and, additionally, annotate the assessment guide to track your proficiency of the professional and technical skills in the field of software engineering. For this task, first copy the `assessment.md` file from the assessment repository to your lab02 repository. Then, for each category for which you decide an assessment is appropriate, you should write a couple of sentences reporting your current level of proficiency and the evidence that you would furnish to support your assessment. If there is not a description next to one of the assessment criteria, then the instructor will assume that you are currently working at the :disappointed: level. Please note that you are responsible for documenting your proficiency of all the technical and professional skills in software engineering by the completion of this long-term software project.

## Assignment Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up to 10%]:**: For lab02 repository associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up to 25%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when the responses to the writing questions presented in the `reflection.md` reveal a proficiency of both writing skills and technical knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing accurate answers.

- **Personal Assessment [up to 15%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when their personal assessment is appropriately documents in the `assessment.md` file.

- **Level of Contribution [up to 30%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when their level of contribution indicates active engagement in the process of planning for contributions to the software engineering project. The engagement should be reported in the reflection document located in this repository.

- **Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills [up to 20%]**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when their contributions reveal that they have improved on the technical knowledge and skills developed during the completion of this assignment. As a part of this grade, the instructor will assess aspects of the sprint 0 including, but not limited to, the use of effective GitHub issues, understanding of ZenHub board, correct use of GitHub flow practices, and understanding of the objectives and inner-workings of GatorMiner.

All grades for this project will be reported through a student's gradebook GitHub repository.

## Assessment Strategy

This assignment will be assessed based on the following components:

- **Percentage of Passing GatorGrader Checks**: If source code is required, you should repeatedly update the implementation of your source code until it passes all of the GatorGrader checks by, for instance, producing the correct output. If technical writing is required, you should repeatedly revise your technical writing until it also passes all of GatorGrader's checks about, for instance, the length of its content.
- **Percentage of Passing GitHub Actions Checks**: You will receive checkmarks for any additional checks on source code and/or technical writing, other than the "Run GatorGrader" check, that are encoded in GitHub Actions. You will receive a checkmark for each passing GitHub Actions check. As with the previous grading component, you are encouraged to repeatedly amend your source code and/or technical writing until all of your GitHub Actions checks pass.

  - Please note that the "Check Spelling" GitHub Actions check may flag proper nouns or other real words if the dictionary it uses does not contain them. If your "Check Spelling" GitHub Actions check is failing due to a correctly spelled word being incorrectly flagged as "unknown" by CSpell, you will need to add the word to the list of words in `.github/cspell.json`.

- **Mastery of Software Engineering Concepts and Skills**: You will receive a checkmark for demonstrating mastery of each of the following concepts and skills of software engineering exercised in this assignment that is not checked by GatorGrader. If you receive checkmarks for all of the following concepts and skills and have all GatorGrader checks pass, you will know that you have mastered all of the learning objectives of this assignment. For this assignment, you must:

  - Make small, focused commits
  - Write commit messages that abide by [the seven rules of a great Git commit](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/message)
  - Correctly explain what the `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)` decorator does
  - Correctly identify two reasons why `test_permit_manager` is unclear
  - Correctly explain why `test_next_sticker_increments_next_sticker_number` is brittle
  - Write tests that are maintainable
